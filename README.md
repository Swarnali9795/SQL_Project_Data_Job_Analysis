# Background
This project was created to better understand and navigate the data analyst job market, with a focus on identifying top-paying roles and the most in-demand skills. By analyzing and streamlining existing data, it aims to highlight the optimal opportunities for aspiring and current data analysts.

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries,locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I leveraged several key tools:

- **SQL:** The core of my analysis, used to query the database and extract critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system chosen for efficiently handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My primary environment for managing the database and executing SQL queries.
- **Git and Github:** Essential for verison control and sharing my SQl scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query in this project was designed to explore a specific aspect of the data analyst job market. Here’s an overview of my approach to each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location to pinpoint the highest-paying roles, showcasing the most lucrative opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Singapore' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in Singapore in 2023:
- **Salary Range:** The top 10 paying data analyst roles in Singapore showcases a notable salary range, from around $105,000 to nearly $150,000.
